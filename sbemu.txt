   This SBEMU variant is compatible with the standard HDPMI32i included in the
   HX runtime package. 


   2. Usage

   The best environment to run SBEMU is
   
   - load JemmEx/Jemm386 in CONFIG.SYS
   - run "JLoad QPIEMU.DLL"
   - run "HDPMI32i -x"
   - run "SBEMU"

   QPIEMU.DLL is needed for real-mode port trapping. Without this helper dll
   support for real-mode cannot be activated by SBEMU - and, btw, it is also
   needed by UNINST.COM, a small tool to unload SBEMU.


   3. SETPVI/RESPVI

    A few protected-mode games will not run with the default settings of SBEMU.
   Then there's a chance that running SETPVI may fix that. However, there exist
   BIOSes that aren't compatible with SETPVI - then you're out of luck. Also,
   SETPVI won't work with Qemm.

    SETPVI will set the PVI flag in cpu register CR4, RESPVI will reset it. When
   this bit is set, it's not possible to disable interrupts in ring 3, since
   CLI/STI will modify the virtual interrupt flag (VIF) only.

    Games that may need SETPVI:
   
   - Stargunner
   - Rise Of The Triad
