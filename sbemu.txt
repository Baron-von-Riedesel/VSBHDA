   This SBEMU variant is compatible with the standard HDPMI32i included in the
   HX runtime package. 


   2. Usage

   The best environment to run SBEMU is
   
   - load JemmEx/Jemm386 in CONFIG.SYS
   - run "JLoad QPIEMU.DLL"
   - run "HDPMI32i -x"
   - optionally run "SETVPI" ( see below )
   - run "SBEMU"

   QPIEMU.DLL is needed for real-mode port trapping. Without this helper dll
   support for real-mode cannot be activated by SBEMU - and, btw, it is also
   needed by UNINST.COM, a small tool to unload SBEMU.


   3. SETVPI/RESVPI

   The HDPMI32i variant supplied with the original SBEMU has some modifications
   to make it compatible with the somewhat buggy DOS extender DOS4/G[W]. This
   works, but OTOH makes it incompatible with HX binaries. Hence this fork, that
   doesn't need those adjustments for HDPMI. To achieve compatibility with
   DOS4/G[W], another approach has been chosen: it is necessary to run a small
   tool, SETVPI.EXE. Usually that's it, most programs will run fine. However, a
   few won't be happy with the effect done by SETVPI.EXE; then another tool,
   RESVPI.EXE, will undo this effect.
