   This SBEMU variant is compatible with the standard HDPMI32i included in the
   HX runtime package. 


   2. Usage

   The steps to load SBEMU are
   
   - load JemmEx/Jemm386 in CONFIG.SYS
   - set environment variable BLASTER
   - run "JLoad QPIEMU.DLL"
   - run "HDPMI32i -x"
   - run "SBEMU"

    QPIEMU.DLL is needed for real-mode port trapping. Without this helper dll
   support for real-mode cannot be activated by SBEMU - and, btw, it is also
   needed by UNINST.COM, a program to unload SBEMU.
    With the BLASTER variable one can select what card SBEMU is to emulate:
   SB, SB Pro or SB 16; for example: "SET BLASTER=A220 I7 D1 H5 T6" will select
   a SB16.


   3. SETPVI/RESPVI

    A few protected-mode games may "freeze" with the default settings of SBEMU.
   Then there's a chance that running SETPVI may fix that. Note that SETPVI
   won't work with Qemm.

    SETPVI will set the PVI flag in cpu register CR4, RESPVI will reset it. When
   this bit is set, it's not possible to disable interrupts in ring 3, since
   CLI/STI will modify the virtual interrupt flag (VIF) only.
