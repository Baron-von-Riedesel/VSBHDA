    VSBHDA is a SoundBlaster emulation program for DOS. It's a fork of SBEMU,
   compatible with the standard HDPMI DPMI hosts included in the HX runtime
   package. 


   2. Requirements

    Besides VSBHDA the following external binaries are needed:

   - HDPMI32i : included in the HX DOS extender runtime package HXRT.
                Download from https://github.com/Baron-von-Riedesel/HX.
                Version of HDPMI32i must be v3.21 or better.

   - HDPMI16i : also included in the HX DOS extender runtime package HXRT.
                This is the 16-bit variant of the DPMI host.

   - Jemm     : To be found at https://github.com/Baron-von-Riedesel/Jemm.
                This package will also contain JLOAD.EXE and QPIEMU.DLL.
                Version must be at least v5.84. Jemm - or rather QPIEMU.DLL
                - is necessary for VSBHDA's support for "real-mode" games.
                Instead of Jemm, Qemm may be used; however, JHDPMI.DLL can
                be loaded and used by Jemm only.


   3. Usage

    VSBHDA consists of two programs: vsbhda.exe and vsbhda16.exe. Due to the
   nature of DPMI, 16-bit and 32-bit DPMI clients must at least have separate
   interrupt tables. This implies that - at least for DPMI v0.9 - there's no
   good way for a 32-bit client to provide services for a 16-bit client - and
   vice versa. Hence vsbhda.exe can only support 32-bit protected-mode games,
   while vsbhda16 is limited to 16-bit protected-mode ones. Both variants
   support real-mode games, though.

   The steps to load the VSBHDA emulation layer are
   
   - load JemmEx/Jemm386 in CONFIG.SYS
   - set environment variable BLASTER
   - run "JLoad QPIEMU.DLL"
   - optionally run "JLoad JHDPMI.DLL" (see below)

   The rest depends on the game that is to run:

    32-bit                 16-bit
   --------------------------------------
    HDPMI32i -x            HDPMI16i -x
    VSBHDA                 VSBHDA16

    Files START.BAT and START16.BAT are examples how this startup sequence
   might look like. Also supplied are STARTL.BAT and START16L.BAT - these
   variants run VSBHDA(16) without JHDPMI.DLL. 

    File UNINST.COM may be used to unload VSBHDA. This must be done if one
   wants to switch from 32-bit to 16-bit and vice versa; the programs
   themselves have problems to detect the presence of the other variant.

    As already mentioned, QPIEMU.DLL is needed for real-mode port trapping;
   also, if it's not installed, UNINST.COM won't work.

    Vsbhda16.exe loads file sndcard.drv during initialization. Due to
   limitations of the 16-bit environment ( a module's code/data segments must
   not exceed 64 kB ) the binary had to be split into two parts.

    With the BLASTER variable one can select what card VSBHDA is to emulate:
   SB, SB Pro or SB 16; for example: "SET BLASTER=A220 I7 D1 H5 T6" will select
   a SB16.

    VSBHDA will understand a few commandline options. Some, like /A, /I, /D, /H,
   /P or /T, are similar to the settings of the BLASTER environment variable
   ( this variable is NOT altered by VSBHDA ). The others are:

     /OPL    : Set OPL3 emulation
     /PM     : Set protected-mode support
     /RM     : Set real-mode support
     /F      : Set frequency
     /VOL    : Set master volume
     /BS     : Set PCM buffer size
     /SD     : Set slowdown factor
     /O      : Set output widget (HDA only)
     /DEV    : Set start index for device scan (HDA only)
     /DIVE   : Set "Runtime Error 200" fix for Borland apps (VSBHDA16 only)

    Options must be followed by a number, without spaces. Options /A and /P
   expect the number to be in hexadecimal, else decimal numbers are required.

   - /F: note that if the frequency isn't supported by the codec, it can't be
     used - that's also true for the default value ( 22050 Hz ). In such cases
     VSBHDA will use a frequency that is supported AND is at least the value
     set by /F ( or the default ).
   - /VOL: needs a one-digit value ( /VOL0 - /VOL9 ). This option sets the
     volume of the real sound hardware ( hda, ac97 ).
   - /BS: the PCM buffer is used for temporary storage of PCM samples, needed
     for format conversions. The argument is the number of 4kB pages used as
     buffer; the default value of 16 (means 64 kB) should be ok for virtual
     all cases, setting it too small will result in page faults.
   - /SD: purpose is to slowdown games. Needs a numeric argument, for example
     /SD100. If this argument is too high, the machine won't respond anymore.
     This option uses the RDTSC instruction - Although usually no problem, this
     instruction is priviledged if bit TSD (bit 2) is set in register CR4; then
     running this instruction in ring3 will cause a GPF.


   4. Details/Hints

   4.1 JHDPMI.DLL

    This JLM is recommended to be loaded before the vsbhda binary. It doesn't
   supply any features for vsbhda directly, but enhances DPMI compliance of
   hdpmi. It ensures that the DPMI host will be the first to receive interrupt
   requests that occur in v86-mode, without the need to modify IVT vectors.
    The utility JHDPMIS.EXE makes JHDPMI display its status. One may see what
   IVT vectors are hooked and how often the hook address has been called.


   4.2 SETPVI/RESPVI

    A few protected-mode games may "freeze" with the default settings of VSBHDA;
   or, it the game uses the Rational DOS extender (DOS4/GW), a register dump may
   be displayed, with the error message "Transfer buffer overflow". Then there's
   a chance that running SETPVI may fix that. Note that SETPVI won't work with
   Qemm.

    SETPVI will set the PVI flag in cpu register CR4, RESPVI will reset it. When
   this bit is set, any protected-mode program running in ring 3 is unable to
   change the interrupt flag (IF), since CLI/STI will modify the virtual
   interrupt flag (VIF) only.


   4.3 Extended Memory

    Some DOS games refuse to run if too much extended memory is available. There
   are some simple software workarounds for such issues:

   - HDPMI's -x cmdline option: this restricts the free DPMI memory to 256MB.
     Optionally, this can be further reduced by appending a digit to -x: -x2
     reduces free memory to 64MB, -x4 to 16MB. However, this is a soft limit,
     since it's just the amount of memory that's reported as free - the program 
     may still allocate more than that, if available.

   - XMSRes: tool to reduce free XMS memory. This TSR can be uninstalled, so
     the reduction may be reverted without reboot.

   - JemmEx's MAXEXT option: tells JemmEx's XMS host to supply a max. amount of
     extended memory.


   4.4 Jemm's NOVCPI Option
   
    If VSBHDA is to work for DOS protected-mode games, those games must use the
   HDPMI32i/HDPMI16i DPMI host. This is usually no problem, because there's an
   API to detect the presence of such a host. However, games may ignore an
   installed DPMI host and use the so-called VCPI API instead to run their very
   own low-level code. This will actually deactivate VSBHDA for the game. To
   cover such cases, Jemm386/JemmEx offers the NOVCPI option. This option must
   be set *after* VSBHDA has been loaded and *before* the game is launched.


   5. Error Messages
   
   - "Sound card IRQ conflict": the sound hardware uses the very same IRQ number
     than the emulated SB ( 2, 5 or 7 ). This is currently rejected ( it may
     confuse the emulator ).

   - "SB found - probably VSBHDA already installed": a SoundBlaster was
     detected. If it's due to an installed VSBHDA, use UNINST.COM to remove the
     running VSBHDA from memory.
   
   - "Jemm/Qemm not installed, or version below 7.03: x.x - disable real-mode
     support": the so-called QPI wasn't found. It's either supplied by Qemm or
     Jemm ( with QPIEMU.DLL loaded ).

   - "HDPMI not installed - disable protected-mode support": running VSBHDA
     under another DPMI host is possible, but not recommended.

   - "Error: Failed installing IO port trap for real-mode.": the v86-monitor
     (Qemm/Jemm) returned something unexpected when the port trapping API was
     called.

   - "Error: Failed installing IO port trap for protected-mode.": the DPMI
     hosts HDPMI32i/HDPMI16i are the only ones implementing the protected-mode
     port trapping API used by VSBHDA.

   - "HDA: card n skipped - no codecs attached": HDA only; VSBHDA didn't find
     any codecs attached to the HDA controller. A controller reset may be
     needed.

   - "HDA: card n skipped - mixer init error": HDA only; VSBHDA was unable to
     query the codec for an appropriate path for sound output.

   - "Pin <n> (<type>) used for output": HDA only; this is a warning that the
     expected output device type ( lineout|speaker|headphone ) wasn't found
     and hence another one had to be used.

   6. Compatibility Issues

    Here are some programs/games listed that require special actions:

    - Aladdin: requires EMS, max. XMS memory is 31MB (XMSRES 31).
    - Blood: setting SB IRQ to 2 or 5 may be required. Generally, on some
      machines the DOS/4GW DOS extender has problems with IRQ 7.
    - Jungle Book: needs SETPVI.EXE to be run before launched.
    - Screamer: set max. XMS memory to 31MB (XMSRES 31).
    - Stargunner: SETUP.EXE must be run without VSBHDA loaded.
    - System Shock: set max. XMS memory to 31MB (XMSRES 31) before running
      HDPMI32i.
    - Windows 3.1: the Windows task switcher duo WSWAP.EXE/DSWAP.EXE isn't
      compatible with JHDPMI.DLL - use START16L.BAT to run VSBHDA.
